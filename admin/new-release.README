How to generate a new cylc release and update the cylc
homepage (on GitHub gh-pages):

 1 run the test battery locally one more time (Travis CI
 should already pass).
 2 update CHANGES.md and commit the change
 3 tag the new release:
    git tag -a x.y.z 'Release x.y.z'
 4 push new commits and tag to cylc/cylc:master
 5 generate new docs and update to gh-pages, as described in the README.update-*
